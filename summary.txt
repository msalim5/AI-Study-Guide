The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the solar system. It orbits our planet at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) and takes roughly 27.3 days to complete one orbit. However, due to the Earth's movement, the full moon cycle (from full moon to full moon) takes about 29.5 days.

The Moon influences life on Earth in many ways. Its gravitational pull causes ocean tides, and its phases have been used for centuries to track time. The Moon has no atmosphere, which means there’s no weather, and its surface is covered in craters, dust, and rocky plains formed by ancient volcanic activity and meteor impacts.

In 1969, NASA’s Apollo 11 mission made history when Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon. Since then, the Moon has remained a focus of space exploration, with new missions planned to study its surface and eventually establish a base for further space travel.

Mysterious yet familiar, the Moon continues to inspire scientists, artists, and dreamers alike.
